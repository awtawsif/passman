## üíª Installation

Before running the password manager, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

  * `bash` (usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS)
  * `jq`: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
  * `openssl`: A robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols and a rich cryptography library.

#### Install Dependencies

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq openssl
```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install jq openssl
```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy jq openssl
```

**macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install jq openssl
```

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Make the main script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x passman.sh
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

To start the password manager, run the `passman.sh` script from your terminal:

```bash
./passman.sh
```

Upon the first run, you will be prompted to set a new master password. Remember this password, as it's crucial for accessing your stored credentials.

### Main Menu Options:

1.  **Add new entry:** Interactively add details for a new credential (website, email, username, password, etc.). You can also choose to generate a strong password automatically.
2.  **Search entries:** Filter your stored credentials by various criteria like website, email, or username.
3.  **View all entries:** Display a list of all your stored credential entries.
4.  **Edit existing entry:** Modify details for an already saved credential.
5.  **Remove entry:** Permanently delete a credential entry from your secure storage.
6.  **Quit:** Exit the application. Your data will be securely locked.
7.  **Change master password:** Update your master password.
